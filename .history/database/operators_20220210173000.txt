MongoDB operators are powerful.

-> Update Operators:-
1. $inc -> increment
2. $min -> minimum
3. $max -> maximum
4. $set -> sets a data to an object property => E.g. book.title = "Math" is set using $set operator.
5. $unset -> removes an property from an object => E.g title property from book object is removed
 
There is no decrement operator in MongoDB hence negative numbers are used with increment operator.

-> Arrays:-
1. $push -> to push data at the end of the array
2. $pop -> to delete the data from the end of the array
3. $pull -> remove an element from  the array => E.g. name = ['pavan','vickie']
                                                     $pull = {
                                                         name: 'pavan';
                                                     }
