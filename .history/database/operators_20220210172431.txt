MongoDB operators are powerful.

-> Update Operators:-
1. $inc -> increment
2. $min -> minimum
3. $max -> maximum
4. $set -> sets a data to an object property => E.g. book.title = "Math" is set using $set operator.
5. $unset -> removes an property from an object => E.g title property from book object is removed
 
There is no decrement operator in MongoDB hence negative numbers are used with increment operator.
